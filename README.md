# DreamSpeedrun
Hello everyone! I bring you all a plugin that's based off Dream's manhunt series! Basically, the plugin will give the hunters a compass to track the speedrunner.

****SETUP:****
1. Download the plugin and put it into your plugins folder.
2. Restart/start your server.
3. Set the speedrunner (/speedrun set <player_name>) or you can use the config.yml.
4. Rejoin and tell your friends to rejoin too.
5. You're done! Everyone except the speedrunner will receive a compass to track the speedrunner down. :)

****COMMANDS/PERMISSIONS:****

``/speedrun - Main command (speedrun.main)``

``/speedrun set <optional_player> - Sets the speedrunner. If no player is provided, it will open up a player selector menu. (speedrun.setspeedrunner)``

``/speedrun reload - Reloads the config. (speedrun.reload)``
